									<h3>about</h3>
									<p>Elden Ring is a dark fantasy RPG that lets you play one of the descendants of the Tarnished. An outcast, you must enter the Lands Between to try to gain re-admittance to the society there as an Elden Lord. To do that, you must reveal the mystery of the fabled Elden Ring. Your adventures in the Lands Between will teem with threats and brim with unknown.</p>
									<p>There, you'll find the main "Overworld" and the "Underworld" of dungeons, catacombs and caves. The Overworld will greet you with many heroes from the time before the Shattering, as well as a generous supply of monsters and other characters to defeat. By contrast, the Underworld will present you with shadowy, terrifying areas — but ones that will ensure that you'll be amply rewarded.</p>
