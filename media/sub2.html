							<h3>Queen Marika the Eternal</h3>
							<p>
								The goddess Marika originally came from the lands of the Numen. She was an Empyrean who ascended to godhood and became ruler of the Lands Between with the assistance of an Outer God: the Greater Will. Marika had a male half by the name of Radagon. The exact nature of their relationship is unclear, but while the two had separate bodies and wills, they were in truth one and the same. As an Empyrean, she was gifted a Shadow, her half-brother Maliketh.

							<h3>Malenia the Severed</h3>
							<p>
								Malenia was born the child of Queen Marika and her second husband, the Elden Lord Radagon. She had a twin by the name of Miquella. Both Malenia and Miquella were born as Empyreans, meaning they had the potential to one day replace their mother as the god of a new age. But since Radagon and Marika were in fact the same person, Malenia and Miquella were born cursed. Malenia was afflicted with the Scarlet Rot, which ravaged her from within and would cost her several limbs, while Miquella was cursed with eternal childhood, unable to ever grow into adulthood. At some point, Malenia encountered a blind swordsman who had sealed away an Outer God of Rot. The swordsman became her master, and trained her in the ways of the blade. Malenia would eventually become a warrior without peer.
